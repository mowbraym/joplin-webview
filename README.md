# Installation

- There are some custom views that need to be added to the database to make this work, they are in the sql folder
- you will need a copy of your database.sqlite file in the folder with the code
- Optionally you will want the resources folder copied there too
- the start script showa how to run it - I need to sudo as my database.sqlite is a soft link to a copy of my db in my nexcloud server. It can run without sudo if this is not the case for you

If you find yourself here and have any interest in this then get in touch and I'll work with you to get it going.
